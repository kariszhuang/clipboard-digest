# ClipboardDigest (Developing...)

**ClipboardDigest** is a Python tool that runs in the background, monitors your clipboard, and creates a daily summary report. It tracks everything you copy, logs it to a local database, and summarizes your copy activity at the end of each day.

## Features

- **Smart Clipboard Monitoring**: Continuously tracks what you copy with efficient change detection
- **AI-Powered Summaries**: Automatically generates concise summaries of lengthy clipboard content
- **Intelligent Content Grouping**: Groups similar content to avoid duplicate summarization and save API costs
- **Daily Insights**: Creates comprehensive daily reports of your clipboard activity
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily configurable through `.env` file with sensible defaults
- **Privacy-Focused**: All data remains local in a SQLite database. Supports local LLM (See [`.env.local_llm`](/.env.local_llm))

## Example Daily Insights

> **Note:** The insights schema is fully customizable to track different metrics or activity patterns based on your needs. In future versions, this structured JSON output will be used to generate an interactive frontend dashboard for better visualization and analysis of your clipboard activity.

  "pattern": "Today exhibited a dynamic workflow with multiple task switches. The day began with Python project setup, followed by intermittent travel research for an upcoming trip to Japan. API documentation research and Docker Compose configuration were the primary development activities, with a focus on resolving technical issues and enhancing project setup. The timeline indicates a well-distributed attention across different tasks, with productive blocks of development work interspersed with research activities.",
  "recommendation": "Maintain the current workflow flexibility, allowing for task switching as needed. Consider allocating specific time blocks for focused development and research to enhance productivity further. It may be beneficial to document the travel research process and findings in a separate note for easy reference and planning."
